## Data Observatory

Access data from CARTO's Data Observatory (DO). Augment your tables with measures and
get boundaries available in the DO.

### Querying Metadata

The full metadata for a DO variable uniquely defines a measure based on the time or timespan vintage,
geographic resolution, and normalization method, if any. Read more about the metadata response in [Data Observatory documentation](https://carto.com/docs/carto-engine/data/measures-functions/#obs_getmetaextent-geometry-metadata-json-max_timespan_rank-max_score_rank-target_geoms).

Search metadata for all United States measures from the 2011 - 2015 American Community Survey
that mention median income, using regex. The results are returned as a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
median_income = cc.data_discovery('United States',
                                  regex='.*median income.*',
                                  time='2011 - 2015')
```

Search metadata for all measures from the 2011 - 2015 5 Year American Community Survey that mentions education using keyword search and match the geographic extent of your table.

```python
median_income = cc.data_discovery('my_table',
                                  keyword='education',
                                  timespan='2011 - 2015')
```

### Augmenting your data

Once you have identified the correct metadata for the DO variables you want, you can augment
an existing CARTO dataset and return it as a Pandas DataFrame. There are two methods
for passing in metadata to augment.

1. Pass the metadata DataFrame created from `cc.data_discovery` into `cc.data`

```python
median_income = cc.data_discovery('my_table',
                                  keyword='education',
                                  timespan='2011 - 2015')
df = cc.data('my_table',
             median_income)
```

2. Or, you can pass in cherry-picked measures from the [Data Observatory catalog](https://cartodb.github.io/bigmetadata/index.html) as a list of dictionaries.
The rest of the metadata will be filled in,
but itâ€™s important to specify the geographic level.

```python
total_population = [{'numer_id': 'us.census.acs.B01003001',
                  'geom_id': 'us.census.tiger.block_group',
                  'numer_timespan': '2011 - 2015'}]
df = cc.data('my_table', total_population)
```

Additionally, you can persist the results as a new CARTO table by passing a new
table name.

```python
df = cc.data('my_table', total_population, persist_as='my_table_population')
```

### Accessing boundaries

Find all the boundaries available in the world, or in a region or country.

```python
all_available_boundaries = cc.data_boundaries()
```

### Getting raw measures and boundaries
